# python-viz

Notebook that I used to present the Python half of the presentation [Doing Data Viz with R & Python](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-dataviz/events/277356179/). 

To install the dependencies required for this notebook, create and activate a new virtual environment and then run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
