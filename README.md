# python-viz

Some Notebooks for navigating the Python visualisation landscape.


* `python_data_viz_survey.ipynb`: Brief survey of core Python viz libraries.
* `python_spatial_viz.ipynb`: Brief survey of some libraries for doing spatial viz with Python.
* `python_viz.ipynb`: Notebook that I used to present the Python half of the presentation [Doing Data Viz with R & Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jhn_DD7oOU&t=2s). 


For the spatial viz notebook, you'll need GDAL installed on your
system. Instructions for Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev

To install the dependencies required for this notebook, create and activate a
new virtual environment and then run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
